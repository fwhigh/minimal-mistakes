This is a blog about machine learning and big data analysis, with a bent toward mathematical first-principles, trying things out empirically, and extremely rapid workflows for proving concepts up front. I also hope to cover some of soft skills that are equally important to professional success as a working data scientist.

I am now a Senior Data Scientist at Netflix in Los Angeles working on content acquisition and production problems. This blog is entirely my own and does not necessarily reflect the views of my employer.

Prior to Netflix I worked at a small adtech startup in New York and had a brief stint at ThoughtWorks, an agile software consulting firm in Chicago.

I hold a PhD in physics from Harvard with specialties in astrophysics and cosmology. I did a postdoc at U Chicago, undergrad at UC Berkeley and some research at Caltech. As an academic I specialized in studies of dark energy and dark matter using gravitational lensing and the clustering of galaxies. You can view the publications from this phase of my career [here](bit.ly/fwhigh_pubs).
