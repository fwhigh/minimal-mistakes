I'm a data scientist working on machine learning systems at Netflix. 
I've also worked at Joymode, a Los Angeles rental startup, 
Velos/Sociocast Networks, a New York adtech startup, 
and briefly at ThoughtWorks. 

I have occasionally served as a pro bono Data Ambassador for DataKind.

I hold a PhD from Harvard and a BA from Berkeley with specialties in astrophysics and cosmology, 
and I've held research positions at U Chicago and Caltech. 
As an academic I specialized in studies of dark energy and dark matter 
using gravitational lensing and the clustering of galaxies. 

This blog exists purely for me to scratch my own creative itch.
